== Description ==

This plugin extends standard woocommerce import products functionality and lets you import, not only from a local file, but also from your google sheet file which you store on your google drive and can be edited by any member of your store team.

Standard woocommerce import, that was introduced by woocommerce team since version 3.1, became a great plugin feature that lets you not use additional plugins and extensions for product import processes. However, if it’s a pain every time when you’re loading csv import files from your local machine, then this plugin is a great choice that lets you not to do it anymore. Just set your google sheet that you store on your google drive once and in the future you will only have to press the button "Import" as usual. Plugin itself will pull the new data from the specified google sheet table.
